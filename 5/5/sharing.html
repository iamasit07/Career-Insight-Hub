        <h2>Software Engineering Interview Experience</h2>
      <p class="intro">Hello Everyone, I am Harshit gupta and i am going to share my expirence for my software interview I found that some companies like Facebook were amazingly professional - all my rounds were conducted so smoothly that such management itself was a motivation to join. Some others weren't as organised, and my worst experience ever was with Adobe, not once but twice!</p>
      <p class="full-text" style="display: none;">
        First...
          When Adobe came to my school in my graduation year, they first screened candidates on written technical tests and cleared just 3 in the entire class. (I was studying in one of the best schools in the country.) In the next interview round, they saw my resume again and realized that my grades were too low and clearly I had been cleared by mistake.
          They said they had planned to take an easy interview and hire almost everybody they selected in the written rounds. However, my grades were too low and they couldn't hire me due to their policies for fresh graduates. I suggested that they could interview me before coming to any decisions, but they refused. So I said "Ah well, OK, no problem." and left.
          
          A few months later, I got a call from Adobe again, and they said that I had been one of the best candidates they had found, and that perhaps we could talk again etc. Well, let's fast forward a bit.
          
          Second...
          Adobe held a walk-in interview session, and candidates were screened through written tests and were invited to be present at a given hour, sometime in the morning. Most of the candidates, including me, were from out of town and had reached therefore much ahead of time. We waited in the lobby until the recruiters appeared, half an hour after the given time. They seated us, about thirty in all, in a board room and thereafter candidates would be taken out in ones and twos. The process was very slow, and most of us were still there at the lunch hour.
          For security reasons, they kept us locked in the board room, and of course, since every door in the building required a card swipe, none of us could go anywhere. We were getting hungry, so in the afternoon, we were given a small recess to go out and eat and come back in twenty minutes. This was getting ridiculous, but we had a smoke and a quick coffee at the nearest cafe, and went back and waited some more.
          
          My turn came in the evening, and I hadn't had a decent meal all day! I met the interviewer in a small meeting room, and all my attention was at his empty pizza box :P . He asked me to write me a recursive program to check if a string is a palindrome. I asked if an iterative solution wouldn't be better here, but he said he wanted a recursive solution. Even as I talked, my attention was at the pizza box. He saw my blank face and said he'd come back in 5 minutes.
          
          To this day, I cannot think of a good reason why anyone would want to write a recursive program to check if a string is a palindrome. I figured he wanted to see if I knew what recursion was. I finally managed to look away from the pizza box for a few moments and quickly wrote a code on the board. He came back and glanced at the code. Then he made a face and said "No no, that's not it!".
          
          That was confusing. I knew my code would work. (Trust me, I do know recursion.) So I verified with him that my code was indeed recursive, and that it would report whether the string was a palindrome or not. He said again "Yes, but that's not it." I asked him if he thought my code had a flaw but he refused to answer. I asked him if he was looking for something specific in the answer, and again he said he couldn't tell me. I asked a couple more questions looking at alternative solutions but got nowhere. So I told him that I wasn't sure I understood what he really wanted me to answer. At that point he said he had no other questions and that I should wait outside. Five minutes later, the HR came and informed me I had not been selected and that I could leave.
          
          After being made to wait all day (without eating), the interview was over in 10 minutes, after a single question, which makes no practical sense but which I still attempted, and the interviewer did not even explain to me what he found lacking.
          
          (I don't think I was rejected for attitude or soft skills; I am a meek person but well spoken and articulate.)
          
          All in all, it was an unpleasant experience. The wait was unnecessary, they could have managed people better with time slots. Also, it's basic hospitality to provide food when your guests are hungry. (Or at least let them go out and eat.) And I believe that an interviewer should explain to a candidate what he is judging him for.</p>
